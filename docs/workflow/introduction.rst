Introduction
============

IBIS, TreeManager and ABAC share the same workflow engine. The workflow engine enables the organization to perform actions based on events in the system.

A workflow is triggered for an event (create, update, delete, etc.) and contains the resource for which the event was triggered (workflow content).

This document describes the events, activities, resolvers and functions available in the workflow engine.
